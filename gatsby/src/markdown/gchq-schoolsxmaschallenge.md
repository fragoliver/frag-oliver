## Your Mission

Today the #GCHQChristmasChallenge returns, pitting 11 to 18-year-olds against a series of tricky puzzles set by some of our finest minds. And this year is our trickiest Challenge yet! The Challenge is presented in the form of a Christmas card, sent by our Director, Anne Keast-Butler, to partners around the world.

The card, available to download below, contains a series of brainteasers, designed by GCHQ’s own puzzle volunteers, specifically for 11 to 18-year-olds.

Your special festive puzzle mission is to complete the 2023 GCHQ Christmas Challenge by solving the puzzles and uncovering the hidden final message

## Resources

To help you prepare for Thursday’s Challenge, we’ve provided a number of resources below, including a digital copy of the Challenge, a teaching pack featuring KS3 and KS4 lesson plans, a hints sheet for teachers and printable certificates. Students can also choose to print a copy of the Challenge to take home to test their families over the festive period.

Our Director, Anne Keast-Butler has recorded a special message, setting students their festive puzzle assignment.

Colin, our Chief Puzzler, is back once again to show you how to get started with completing the GCHQ Christmas Challenge.

A BSL introduction to the Challenge is also available.
